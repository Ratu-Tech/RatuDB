/**
 * This module provides a space in OpenSearch for the community to easily experiment with new ideas and innovate.
 * Ideally, this is where an experimental features will reside before it can be promoted to the corresponding directory
 * in the project root. The sandbox module contains three subdirectories, that mirror the root libs, modules and
 * plugins directories, each with similar intention.
 *
 * All artifacts from the sandbox/libs and sandbox/modules will be included in the snapshot distributions automatically.
 * During assembling distributions, however, we will check if the following two conditions are met, for including the
 * sandbox modules,

 * 1. The distribution is a snapshot i.e. the build system property build.snapshot is set to true. We use this because,
 * it will prevent accidental inclusion of these artifacts in a release distribution.
 *
 * 2. The sandbox.enabled system property is set to true. This new extra flag is added because we can exclude the
 * modules from the snapshot distributions, if needed. For instance, we may want to run performance tests on snapshots
 * without the sandbox modules.
 *
 * To build the distributions without the sandbox modules,
 *   ./gradlew assemble -Dsandbox.enabled=false
 *
 * Similarly we can run OpenSearch from source without the sandbox modules
 *   ./gradlew run -Dsandbox.enabled=false
