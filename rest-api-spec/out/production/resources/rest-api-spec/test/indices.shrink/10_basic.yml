"Shrink index via API":
  # creates an index with one document solely allocated on a particular data node
  # and shrinks it into a new index with a single shard
  # we don't do the relocation to a single node after the index is created
  # here since in a mixed version cluster we can't identify
  # which node is the one with the highest version and that is the only one that can safely
  # be used to shrink the index.
