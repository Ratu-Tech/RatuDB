  # .tasks index is created when the open index operation completes, so we should delete .tasks index finally,
  # if not, the .tasks index may introduce unexpected warnings and then cause other test cases to fail.
  # Delete the .tasks index directly will also introduce warning, but currently we don't have such APIs which can delete one
  # specified task or clear all completed tasks, so we have to do so. Expect we can introduce more tasks related APIs in future
